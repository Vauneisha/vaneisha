									This was not always my strength and I proud to now be  able to describe myself as such. 
									I was offered tricks which are essentially guidance  and all  I needed to do was apply them and be concistent.
									In the begining, I had always found ways to discredit the tricks offered until, I figured my way was not kiiling me but I was not living.
									I started to view situations/issues on the positive side- that did not happen overnight I had disclpine myself that there is good surrounding me. 
									Eventually, I started being kind to myself and my next step is to find a mentor. 
									</p>
									</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Being Persistent</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p> In the past I participated in many activites, and right at the moment when its completed I back out.
									I found content in that I was essential in getting possibly a project to its finish line. But I never accpted the credits even when I was ooffered.
									I never felt I desrved it , even when others opinion didnt agree. 
									The truth was, I akways make myself a promise to complete stuff; establsih perimeters so I could not quit- but I still did. 
									I had a wake up call when it was nearing the time  to graduate. 
									I was determine to not give up. I started with small projects and still leveling up. But I do fall back but those times I did not accept it.
									</p>
									</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Open minded</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
									being open-minded about others and the circumstances of our lives can create more ease, curiosity and even delight.
									It also can lead to open-heartedness, which allows us to connect more compassionately with others as well as ourselves. 
									I did not always have a handle on my emotional intellignece; have not yet  mastered it but I have not stopped  learning.
									So far being open minded, challeges me to see the world through various lens. 
									I am appreciate situations for what it is and extremely grateful I can consciouly and to some extent sub consciouly pass no neagtive judgements as best as possible.
									</p>
